# Dashboard Visualizations Guide

This document explains each visualization present in the Olist E-Commerce 360 Dashboard, grouped by the navigation tabs.

## 1. 📊 Executive Overview

### Sales Trend Over Time
- **Chart Type**: Line Chart (Time Series)
- **Data Source**: `orders_dataset` (order_purchase_timestamp)
- **Purpose**: Tracks the growth of order volume over the months.
- **How to read**: Upward trends indicate growth. Sharp drops at the end may indicate incomplete data for the current month.

### Order Funnel
- **Chart Type**: Funnel Chart
- **Data Source**: `orders_dataset` (status timestamps)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the conversion rate of orders through the fulfillment process.
- **Stages**:
    - **Total Orders**: All placed orders.
    - **Approved**: Payment confirmed.
    - **In Transit**: Handed over to logistics carrier.
    - **Delivered**: Successfully reached the customer.
- **Insight**: Identifies bottlenecks in the logistics chain (e.g., high drop-off between Approved and In Transit).

### Top 10 Categories by Revenue
- **Chart Type**: Horizontal Bar Chart
- **Data Source**: Merged `products` + `order_items`
- **Purpose**: Highlights the best-selling product categories.
- **How to read**: Longer bars indicate higher total revenue generated by that category.

## 2. 🕸️ Product Network

### Product Co-Purchase Network
- **Chart Type**: Network Graph (Node-Edge)
- **Data Source**: `order_items` (items bought in the same `order_id`)
- **Purpose**: Shows relationships between product categories.
- **Components**:
    - **Nodes**: Product Categories.
    - **Edges (Lines)**: Connect categories that are frequently bought together.
    - **Weight**: Thickness/Color indicates frequency of co-occurrence.
- **Insight**: Used for cross-selling strategies (e.g., "People who buy Bed/Bath also buy Decor").

## 3. 💬 Customer Sentiment

### Review Score Distribution
- **Chart Type**: Bar Chart / Histogram
- **Data Source**: `order_reviews`
- **Purpose**: Shows the breakdown of customer satisfaction ratings (1 to 5 stars).
- **Insight**: A skew towards 5 stars is healthy. A U-shape (high 1s and 5s) indicates polarized experiences.

### Sentiment vs Rating Alignment (Radar)
- **Chart Type**: Radar Chart
- **Data Source**: `order_reviews` (NLP analysis on `review_comment_message`)
- **Purpose**: Validates if the text sentiment (VADER score) matches the star rating.
- **How to read**: Each axis represents a Star Rating (1-5). The value is the average Sentiment Score (-1 to +1). Ideally, 5 stars should have high positive sentiment, and 1 star should be negative.

### Word Cloud of Negative Reviews
- **Chart Type**: Word Cloud (Image)
- **Data Source**: `order_reviews` (Filtered for < 3 stars)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the most common words found in negative reviews.
- **Insight**: Quickly highlights pain points (e.g., "delay", "delivery", "broken").

## 4. 🌍 Geographic Footprint

### Geographic Customer Distribution
- **Chart Type**: Scatter Map
- **Data Source**: `geolocation_dataset` + `customers_dataset`
- **Purpose**: Maps the density of customers across Brazil.
- **Components**:
    - Dots represent customer locations (aggregated by zip code).
- **Insight**: Shows market penetration and helps in planning logistics centers (e.g., concentration in São Paulo).

## 5. 🔮 Predictive Analytics

### Sales Forecasting
- **Chart Type**: Line Chart (Historical + Predicted)
- **Data Source**: `orders_dataset` (Resampled Monthly)
- **Algorithm**: Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA).
- **Purpose**: Predicts future sales trends for the next 3 months.
- **Insight**: Helps in inventory planning and cash flow management.

### Late Delivery Prediction (Classification Evaluation)
- **Confusion Matrix**: Heatmap showing True Positives vs False Positives etc. Evaluates model accuracy.
- **ROC Curve**: Line chart showing trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the Logistic Regression model used to predict if an order will be late based on weight/price.

### Customer Segments Distribution
- **Chart Type**: Treemap
- **Data Source**: RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the proportion of customers in different loyalty segments (e.g., Champions, At Risk).
- **How to read**: Size of the box represents the number of customers in that segment.

## 6. 🧠 Strategic Deep Dive

    - **X-Axis**: Revenue (Log scale often used).
    - **Y-Axis**: Late Delivery Rate (Risk).
- **Purpose**: Segments sellers into "Stars" (High Rev, Reliable) vs "Risky" (High Rev, Late).
